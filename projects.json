        "description": "Using my results from the \"Enneagram\" personality test I created this brand. I aimed to communicate the traits my test results showed through visual cues and a unique brand application. Additionally I wanted to create a logo that used imagery related to my personality's traits, so I created this logo which combines a shield with the name of my personality type. The project culminated in me mocking up an imaginary adventure card game to reflect my research and traits."
